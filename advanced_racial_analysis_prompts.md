## Usage Guidelines for These Prompts

### Analytical Approach
- **Start with descriptive statistics** before moving to complex comparisons
- **Control for confounding variables** when examining racial disparities  
- **Look for patterns** rather than making causal claims
- **Consider multiple explanations** for observed disparities

### Interpretation Cautions
- **Correlation ≠ Causation**: Patterns may reflect systemic factors beyond individual incidents
- **Multiple Factors**: Race intersects with socioeconomic, geographic, and historical factors
- **Data Limitations**: Officer perceptions and reporting may contain bias
- **Context Matters**: Individual incidents occur within broader social and institutional contexts

### Policy Implications
- **Focus on actionable insights** that could improve police practices
- **Identify training opportunities** based on disparity patterns
- **Highlight successful deescalation** patterns that could be replicated
- **Support evidence-based policy** discussions about police reform

### Ethical Considerations
- **Respect dignity** of all individuals involved in these incidents
- **Avoid stigmatization** of any racial or ethnic groups
- **Support accountability** and transparency in policing
- **Promote equity** and justice in law enforcement practices

These advanced queries are designed to uncover meaningful patterns that can inform police accountability, training improvements, and policy reforms while maintaining analytical rigor and sensitivity to the serious nature of police use of force incidents.
