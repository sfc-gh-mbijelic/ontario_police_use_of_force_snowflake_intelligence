- **Complete table definitions** for all 5 CSV files
- **Comprehensive semantic view** (`POLICE_USE_OF_FORCE_SEMANTIC_VIEW`)
- **Detailed setup instructions** for Cortex Analyst
- **Usage notes** and best practices

### 2. `police_use_of_force_semantic_model.yaml`
- **Ready-to-use YAML configuration** for Cortex Analyst
- **75+ dimensions and measures** for comprehensive analysis
- **Business definitions and glossary** for better AI understanding
- **Synonyms and descriptions** to improve query understanding

### 3. Original CSV Files (5 files)
- `EN_DATA_DICTIONARY_2023.csv` - Metadata and variable definitions
- `Police Use of Force - Main Records 2023.csv` - Primary incident data
- `Police Use of Force - Individual Records 2023.csv` - Individual-level details
- `Police Use of Force - Cycle Probe Records 2023.csv` - CEW usage cycles
- `Police Use of Force - Weapons Records 2023.csv` - Weapon information

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create Tables and Load Data
```sql
-- 1. Run the table creation scripts
USE DATABASE your_database;
USE SCHEMA your_schema;

-- Execute the CREATE TABLE statements from snowflake_table_definitions.sql

-- 2. Load your CSV data using COPY INTO commands
COPY INTO EN_DATA_DICTIONARY_2023
FROM @your_stage/EN_DATA_DICTIONARY_2023.csv
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = CSV HEADER = TRUE SKIP_BLANK_LINES = TRUE);

COPY INTO POLICE_USE_OF_FORCE_MAIN_RECORDS_2023
FROM @your_stage/Police_Use_of_Force_Main_Records_2023.csv
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = CSV HEADER = TRUE SKIP_BLANK_LINES = TRUE);

-- Repeat for other tables...
```

### Step 2: Create the Semantic View
```sql
-- Execute the semantic view creation from snowflake_table_definitions.sql
-- This creates POLICE_USE_OF_FORCE_SEMANTIC_VIEW
```

### Step 3: Set Up Cortex Analyst
1. **Upload semantic model**:
   - In Snowsight: AI & ML ‚Üí Cortex Analyst ‚Üí Create Semantic Model
   - Upload `police_use_of_force_semantic_model.yaml`
   - Update database/schema names in the YAML file

2. **Create analyst instance**:
   ```sql
   CREATE CORTEX ANALYST police_use_of_force_analyst
   SEMANTIC_MODEL = 'police_use_of_force_semantic_model'
   DESCRIPTION = 'AI analyst for Ontario police use of force data analysis';
   ```

### Step 4: Test Your Setup
Try these sample queries with your Cortex Analyst:

- *"What are the trends in use of force incidents by race and time period?"*
- *"How often is deescalation attempted before using force?"*
- *"Which demographics are most likely to experience serious force applications?"*
- *"What is the relationship between weapon presence and injury outcomes?"*

### Step 5: Integrate with Snowflake Intelligence
1. Navigate to AI & ML ‚Üí Intelligence
2. Create or modify an existing agent
3. Add your Cortex Analyst as a tool
4. Configure permissions and test integration

## üéØ Key Features

### Rich Semantic Model
- **Pre-calculated analytics** for immediate insights
- **Business-friendly names** for better AI understanding

- **25+ measures** including rates, averages, and counts
- **Synonyms and descriptions** for natural language queries
- **Business definitions** for accurate interpretation

## üìä Sample Analysis Areas

### Demographics & Disparities
- Force usage patterns by race, age, and gender
- Injury rates across demographic groups
- Geographic distribution by police service

### Force Effectiveness & Safety
- Deescalation success rates
- Injury outcomes by force type
- CEW usage patterns and effectiveness
- Weapon presence impact on outcomes

### Policy & Training Insights
- Time-based patterns (shifts, days, seasons)
- Multi-officer vs single-officer incidents
- Force escalation vs deescalation patterns
- Risk factor correlation analysis

### Operational Analytics
- Police service comparisons
- Assignment type analysis (patrol, tactical, etc.)
- Location type impact on force usage
- Incident type categorization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Data Privacy & Security
- Implement appropriate access controls
- Consider data masking for sensitive information
- Regular security audits for compliance
- Restrict access based on legitimate need

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor query performance and costs
- Consider materialized views for frequent queries
- Optimize warehouse sizing for your usage patterns
- Regular statistics updates for query optimization

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Update semantic model as data patterns change
- Refine dimensions and measures based on user feedback
- Monitor AI query accuracy and adjust descriptions
- Regular data quality checks and validation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **YAML parsing errors**: Check indentation and syntax
2. **Data type mismatches**: Verify CSV data types match table definitions
3. **Missing relationships**: Ensure BATCH_FILE_NAME linking is correct
4. **Query performance**: Consider adding indexes on key fields

### Support Resources
- Snowflake Cortex Analyst documentation
- Snowflake Intelligence setup guides
- YAML syntax validation tools
- SQL performance optimization guides

## üìà Next Steps

1. **Load and validate your data** using the provided table definitions
2. **Test the semantic view** with direct SQL queries
3. **Configure Cortex Analyst** using the YAML model
4. **Train users** on natural language query capabilities
5. **Monitor and optimize** based on usage patterns
6. **Expand the model** as new analysis needs emerge
