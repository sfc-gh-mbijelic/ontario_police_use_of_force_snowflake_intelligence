## Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic overview questions to test data connectivity
2. **Test Historical Integration**: Verify that multi-year queries work correctly
3. **Check PDF Search**: Test document search functionality if configured
4. **Build Complexity**: Gradually move to more complex multi-dimensional analyses
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Try questions that might reveal data limitations
6. **Verify Responses**: Cross-check agent responses against your known data
7. **Test Integrated Analysis**: Try prompts that combine statistical data with document search
8. **Refine Questions**: Adjust prompts based on how well the agent understands them
9. **Document Issues**: Note any questions that produce unclear or incorrect responses

## Expected Response Quality

Your agent should:
- Provide specific numbers and percentages for both current and historical data
- Include appropriate context about data limitations, especially for historical periods
- **Historical Analysis**: Clearly distinguish between data sources (2020-2022 vs. 2023)
- **PDF Search**: Reference relevant documents and acknowledge search limitations
- **Integrated Responses**: Combine statistical findings with document insights when appropriate
- Explain technical terms (CEW, OC spray, etc.)
- Acknowledge when data doesn't support certain conclusions
- Note data quality differences between historical and current datasets
- Suggest related questions when appropriate
- Maintain professional, objective tone throughout
- **Multi-Year Context**: Provide appropriate context for trend interpretations
