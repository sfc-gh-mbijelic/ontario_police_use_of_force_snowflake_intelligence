## Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic overview questions to test data connectivity
2. **Build Complexity**: Gradually move to more complex multi-dimensional analyses
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Try questions that might reveal data limitations
4. **Verify Responses**: Cross-check agent responses against your known data
5. **Refine Questions**: Adjust prompts based on how well the agent understands them
6. **Document Issues**: Note any questions that produce unclear or incorrect responses

## Expected Response Quality

Your agent should:
- Provide specific numbers and percentages
- Include appropriate context about data limitations
- Explain technical terms (CEW, OC spray, etc.)
- Acknowledge when data doesn't support certain conclusions
- Suggest related questions when appropriate
- Maintain professional, objective tone throughout
