## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Snowflake account with Cortex Analyst and Search Services enabled
- Ontario Police Use of Force CSV data files (2020-2023)
- PDF technical reports (optional, for enhanced search capabilities)
- Appropriate data access permissions

### 1. Set Up Snowflake Tables
```sql
-- Run the table creation scripts
USE DATABASE your_database;
USE SCHEMA your_schema;

-- Execute snowflake_table_definitions.sql
-- This creates 7 tables + 1 comprehensive semantic view + PDF search service
-- Includes both 2023 current data and 2020-2022 historical data integration
```

### 2. Load Data
```sql
-- Create stage and upload CSV files
CREATE STAGE uof_csv_stage;

-- Use Snowsight Load Data wizard or COPY INTO commands
-- to load your 7 CSV files into the tables (5 x 2023 + 2 x historical)

-- Optional: Load PDF technical reports
-- Upload PDFs to UOF_TECHNICAL_REPORTS_STAGE for enhanced search capabilities
```

### 3. Deploy Semantic Model
1. Upload `police_use_of_force_semantic_model.yaml` to Cortex Analyst
2. Update database/schema names in the YAML file
3. Test the semantic model with basic queries

### 4. Create Intelligence Agent
1. Create new agent in Snowflake Intelligence
2. Connect to your Cortex Analyst semantic model  
3. Use `agent_response_instructions.md` for system prompts
4. Implement `agent_planning_instructions.txt` for statistical reasoning
5. Test with queries from `agent_sample_prompts.md`
