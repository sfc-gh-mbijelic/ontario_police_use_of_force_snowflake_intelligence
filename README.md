## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Snowflake account with Cortex Analyst enabled
- Ontario Police Use of Force CSV data files (2023)
- Appropriate data access permissions

### 1. Set Up Snowflake Tables
```sql
-- Run the table creation scripts
USE DATABASE your_database;
USE SCHEMA your_schema;

-- Execute snowflake_table_definitions.sql
-- This creates 5 tables + 1 comprehensive semantic view
```

### 2. Load Data
```sql
-- Create stage and upload CSV files
CREATE STAGE uof_csv_stage;

-- Use Snowsight Load Data wizard or COPY INTO commands
-- to load your 5 CSV files into the tables
```

### 3. Deploy Semantic Model
1. Upload `police_use_of_force_semantic_model.yaml` to Cortex Analyst
2. Update database/schema names in the YAML file
3. Test the semantic model with basic queries

### 4. Create Intelligence Agent
1. Create new agent in Snowflake Intelligence
2. Connect to your Cortex Analyst semantic model  
3. Use `agent_response_instructions.md` for system prompts
4. Implement `agent_planning_instructions.txt` for statistical reasoning
5. Test with queries from `agent_sample_prompts.md`

## üéØ Key Features

### Advanced Semantic Modeling
- **75+ dimensions** for comprehensive analysis
- **8 fact measures** for direct data access
- **Rich synonyms** for natural language understanding
- **Business context** integration from data dictionary

### Sample Analysis Capabilities
- *"Compare injury rates between racial groups while controlling for resistance level, weapon presence, and time of day"*
- *"How do racial disparities in CEW usage vary by police service and officer backup presence?"*
- *"What combinations of factors are most predictive of serious injury outcomes?"*
- *"Analyze the statistical significance of deescalation effectiveness across demographic groups"*
